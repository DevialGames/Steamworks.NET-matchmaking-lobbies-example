# Steamworks Lobbies & Matchmaking in Unity 5.3.2
Steamworks.NET (https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) is REQUIRED for this to work. This is intended to be a **BAREBONES** implementation of Steamworks.NET, for developers to expand on.

Common mistakes :
- Make sure steam is running in the background.
- Include a file named "steam_appid.txt" in the directory of your executable. In that text file should simply be the number of your unique appid. Spacewars is 480
